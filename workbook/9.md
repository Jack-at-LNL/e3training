Chapter 9 : Dependence, Dependence, and Dependence
==

# Lesson Overview

In this lesson, you'll learn how to do the following:
* 





## Entering the gray zone
 
 
 
* Roll back to the asyn version, and set `NULL` in `PCRE_DEP_VERSION` by overwriting `CONFIG_MODULE.local`.

```
$ echo "PCRE_DEP_VERSION:=" > configure/CONFIG_MODULE.local
```

* Check these variables through

```
$ make vars |grep "DEP_VERSION ="
ASYN_DEP_VERSION = 4.33.0
PCRE_DEP_VERSION = 
```
* Rebuild it

```
$ make clean
$ make buld
```
Can you compile it?  The answer is **YES** or **NO**.  If the answer is **NO**, we understand this, because of the above example for asyn. 

However, if the answer is **YES**, what happens? Even if there is no information in the compiling log such as `-I/epics/base-3.15.5/require/3.0.4/siteMods/pcre/8.41.0/include`, one should have no difficult to compile it. Why? Could you explain this?  The header file `pcre.h` is defined in `StreamDevice/src/RegexpConverter.cc`.  


``` 
$  ldd  /epics/base-3.15.5/require/3.0.4/siteLibs/linux-x86_64/lib* |grep pcre 
        libpcre.so.3 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpcre.so.3 (0x00007f35eda3e000)
        libpcre.so.3 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpcre.so.3 (0x00007eff88929000)
/epics/base-3.15.5/require/3.0.4/siteLibs/linux-x86_64/libpcre.so.8.41.0:

 $ ldd  /epics/base-3.15.5/require/3.0.4/siteLibs/linux-x86_64/libADPlugin* |grep pcre
        libpcre.so.3 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpcre.so.3 (0x00007eff250c6000)
        libpcre.so.3 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpcre.so.3 (0x00007fc257ff6000)
```
